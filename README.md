### Loading Needed Requirments
When in the cloned repository run
```
pip install -r requirments.txt    
```
If you get this warning message
```
command not found: pip  
```
Try running 
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirments.txt    
```
If this fails you may need to install pip, which assuming you have python downloaded can be done using
```
python3 get-pip.py
```
or 
```
python get-pip.py
```
